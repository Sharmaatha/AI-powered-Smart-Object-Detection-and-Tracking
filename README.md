# Object Detection and Tracking Project 

This project detects and tracks objects in real-time video using computer vision techniques.  
It draws bounding boxes around detected objects and follows them across frames, making it suitable for use cases like surveillance, people counting, and intrusion detection.

# Features
- Real-time object detection from video feed
- Object tracking with bounding boxes
- Works on custom image files 
- Accurate detection with minimal false positives

#Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning Model(YOLO/SSD/or others can be used

# Sample Output
 Input Video---> Detection + Tracking Output 
 Upload an image that has the onjects that need to be tracked [Input](results/input_sample.png) | 
 Tracks the output according to the uploaded input [Output](results/demo)

#Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object-Detection-Tracking-Project.git
